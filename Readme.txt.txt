1) 
I think the abstract class is easier than the interface. 
I did the abstract class first so I put alot more time into creating that class than I did the interface.
If I had to jduge it by time put in I would say the interface was easier, however I was able to copy and paste
alot of my abstract methods which made it quicker. If I had started with the Interface I would have put mroe work
into the interface as I would have needed to write every method instead of having a super class with methods I can borrow.

2)
I would choose abstract classes when I want to pass alot of common methods that can be used by the children
but I want my children to be required to use the abstract methods that will differentiate them. As for interfaces
I am not sure when or why I would want to use this but it could be useful for setting up a program that needs to have
many methods directed by the interface.

3)
In the abstract class I was able to make many super methods that my child classe could call on while using the
abstract methods to define my child classes. With the interface I jsut had to write to very similiar classes
without the assistance of my super class which means I wrote far more code to achieve the same results.

Readme Syllabus Questions.

1) 
HW0 includes The abstract Employy.java class an Hourly.java class that extends Employee and 
a Salary.java class that extends employee. For HW0Int I have the same files but isntead of extending Employee
the child classes implement Employee. In order to run from the command line you will need to keep the two
zip files seperate and compile in seperate folders.

2) 
   javac *.java
   java Payroll
Those commands will run my program as long as you are in the correct directory.

3)
I followed the instructions mainly.

One of the largest issues we encountered was getting the type of employee and name of employee.
We spent a lot of time messing with getters and setters. I  know its simple but it really through us
for a loop. the rest of the program felt natural to write.
